### How or where did you first hear about [TC]?

* 60% of respondents found [TC] through the LFS server list.
* 27% heard about it through friends or team mates.
* The rest through social media or our website.

This highlights the need for a larger or more consistent social media presence. The number of people who heard about us through friends or team mates was larger than we initially expected.

### What made you want to continue being a part of this community?

* 81% of respondents said they wanted to continue being a part of this community because of the CityDriving servers.
* 60% said they would stay because they liked the way the team, services and community are run.
* 50% want to stick around because of the community itself.
* 21% want to see what else we have to offer in the future.

CityDriving is still firmly the centre of attention but around a fifth of the community are keen to see what we have to offer in future. Since half of the respondents said they are sticking around because of the community itself, we need to focus as much on building the community as we do on maintaining our existing services.

### How would you rate the [TC] website and community forum?

![How would you rate the [TC] website and community forum?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TC-Gaming/Survey-2015-Results/master/img/how-would-you-rate-the-tc-website-and-community-forum.png)

* 94% of respondents were satisfied with our website and forum.
* 6% of respondents are not happy with it.

Here are some common improvement suggestions:

* Up-voting system for posts and threads
* More forum theme choice
* Higher contrast theme across the whole website (More colour)
* Bringing the statistics system, auto-market, rules and fine list in line with the style of the site
* More statistics
* Single sign-on (TRS, TC, Forum)
* Rule translations
* Make it easier to find things
* Remove "Member Login" button from website
* Make the administration tasks section clearer

We hear you, we're on it!

### How would you rate your [TC] Gaming experience?

![How would you rate your [TC] Gaming experience?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TC-Gaming/Survey-2015-Results/master/img/how-would-you-rate-your-tc-gaming-experience.png)

* 85% of respondents said they are finding their experience enjoyable
* 15% want more from us

Common responses were:

* Gameplay being ruined by players still being unaware of simple rules
* Offer more game servers
* The community has become stale/repetitive/boring and nothing new is happening
* We need to offer more events
* Our administration is professional
* Great people, great services
* Friendly, cozy, approachable, original, popular

### On average, how many hours a day do you engage with [TC]?

![On average, how many hours a day do you engage with [TC]?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TC-Gaming/Survey-2015-Results/master/img/on-average-how-many-hours-a-day-do-you-engage-with-tc.png)

* 9% under an hour
* 30% between 1 and 2 hours
* 29% between 2 and 4 hours
* 18% between 4 and 6 hours
* 14% more than 6 hours

The levels of engagement were not a surprise but when we saw this information as percentages it showed us how much of your time we are responsible for.

### How do you feel about the way the [TC] team runs its services?

![How do you feel about the way the [TC] team runs its services?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TC-Gaming/Survey-2015-Results/master/img/how-do-you-feel-about-the-way-tc-runs-its-services.png)

* 81% are satisfied with how we run our services
* 19% feel we need to make some improvements

Common responses were:

* Some members of the community are seemingly treated differently (biased decisions, double standards)
* Rules and regulations are, at times, too strict
* Some  are more approachable than others
* Some [TC] Members are power hungry
* Some [TC] Members communication skills are poor
* Some [TC] Members take things too seriously
* Admin decisions in user reports and unban requests need to be more transparent
* The new chase system needs refinement
* [TC] members are not sociable enough in game, in Teamspeak and on the forum
* [TC] Member activity is low (you only see the same few people)
* It's too difficult to join the [TC] team. There needs to be less emphasis on driving and more on other skills
* Severity of punishments vary depending on the admin
* Let the community have more of a say in decisions surrounding service changes (eg map rotations, layout changes, etc.)
* Offer servers for people outside of Europe (pings are too high)
* Server rules need to be more extensive to account for so called "unwritten rules"

We have already started taking steps to ensure that problems like those mentioned above are addressed, this will of course be an ongoing process. We thank you for your honesty.

### What do you want to see from [TC] Gaming in the future?

* Minecraft, ETS2, CS:GO, Gmod, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa,
* Racing...
* Get a YouTube presence
* [TC] needs to expand
* Stay LFS based (stick to what we know we're good at)
* Larger variety of events, more frequent and regular

Mixed opinions but definitely food for thought!

### Do you have any concerns about the current operation of [TC]?

![Do you have any concerns about the current operation of [TC]?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TC-Gaming/Survey-2015-Results/master/img/do-you-have-any-concerns-about-the-current-operatin-of-tc.png)

* 84% of people had little or no concerns
* 16% of people had some concerns

Some common thoughts:

* Admins seem to be exempt from the rules
* [TC] members are too strict when enforcing rules (trigger happy)

Most responses were focussed upon these 2 points. Although it's hard to swallow, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that this does not appear to be the case from now on. The reality is, admins are treated as equally as is reasonably possible to non-[TC] members. We know we need to be more transparent about these things so watch this space!

### What would you like to see implemented into the [TC] City Driving servers?

* Chase cool-down for rejoining
* !move adds a message on a player's screen rather than just in chat
* More layouts for each track (more than 1 layout per track, changes every few days)
* !requests are stored in a list that can be cleared by the DJ
* No pitlane auto-spec
* Make XP and RP useful for something
* Weekly/daily challenges (be in 5 chases, win 10 chases, drive x km, etc)
* Street racing system
* More ways to make money
* Better in-game display for !stats and !rules
* Tweak the chase system (more lenient for cops)

Noted!

### Are you happy with the frequency of organised events?

* Only 38% were happy with the frequency of the events we organise
* 62% were either indifferent of feel we need more

We sort of agree to be honest, more events, more variety, more regular, we're on it!

### What's your favourite [TC] activity (event) that you've enjoyed so far?
